## USER STORIES
As an end user, I desire the capability to navigate FilMove utilizing hand-motion detection, and seamlessly search for movies by genre. Additionally, I seek the convenience of being presented with a recommended movie upon clicking the "Watch Now" button, thereby eliminating the need to spend excessive time searching for content. Moreover, I expect to have access to comprehensive movie details for the content I choose to view.

## Major Hurdles
I would say my major hurdles was just making sure my routes in backend and frontend for CRUD operations were the same.

## Next Steps
My next plan for my app is to create more hand motion features and develop it to be TV friendly so I can cast my app to the tv.
